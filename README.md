# Sign-Language-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning

This is a project created to recognize Bengali Sign Language for both digits and characters.
This project utilizes Deep Learning techniques and it employs an ensemble model which uses a Deep-CNN paired with Random Forest/Decision Tree and XGBoost classifier to see which one performs the best. 

After several experimentations, both Digit and Character recognition gave the best performance using the XGBoost classifier.

With our project, we aim to further develop this to help the deaf and dumb community of Bangladesh where everyone will be able to communicate with ease and create a more inclusive environment.
